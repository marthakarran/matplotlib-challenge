Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

Include 3 observations about the results of the study. Use the visualizations you generated from the study data as the basis for your observations.

1) Accourding to the graph, "Tumor Response to Treatment," Capomulin resulted in a decrease in tumor volume over the course of 45 days, whereas the tumors of the mice administered the three other drugs grew at a similar rate over the course of 45 days. 

2) According to the graph, "Metastatic Spread During Treatment," mice in all four groups had metastatic spread over the course of 45 days, but the rate was slowest for the mice administered Capomulin and fastest for mice administered the Placebo. 

3) According to the graph, "Survival During Treatment," over 80% of the mice administered Capomulin survived after 45 days. After 45 days, less than 50% of mice administered Placebo and Ketapril survived, and less than 40% of mice administered Infubinal survived. 

4) According to these graphs, and the graph "Tumor Change over 45 Day Treatment," tumors in mice administered Capumulin responded better than tumors in mice administered the other three drugs.
